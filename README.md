### Modularity and Architecture
The NASA application was developed with SOLID principles and MVVM based architecture. 
Afterwards, VIPER module was made and UI and Unit tests were written.

### UI
The application, which has 3 separate "tabs", has a different UI architecture in each tab:

- Curiosity Page 
: was made with a storyboard with two separate collectionView structures.

- Opportunity Page
: It was done completely programmatically with the Opportunity Page "Compositional Layout" structure.
It has a button where you can play with the dynamic layouts of the Collection structure.

- Spirit Page 
: was created as a hybrid collectionView, its dynamics were interfered with code.
 It was created with the help of Storyboard. It also has a fully programmatic Bottom Sheet for filtering.

## Frameworks
- Alamofire
- SDWebImage
- Hero
- Lottie
- Snapkit
